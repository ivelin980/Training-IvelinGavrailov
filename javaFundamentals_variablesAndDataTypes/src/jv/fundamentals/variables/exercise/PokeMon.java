/**
 * A Poke Mon is a special type of pokemon which likes to Poke others. But at
 * the end of the day, the Poke Mon wants to keeps statistics, about how many
 * pokes it has managed to make. The Poke Mon pokes his target, and then
 * proceeds to poke another target. The distance between his targets reduces his
 * poke power. You will be given the poke power the Poke Mon has, N – an
 * integer. Then you will be given the distance between the poke targets, M – an
 * integer. Then you will be given the exhaustionFactor Y – an integer. Your
 * task is to start subtracting M from N until N becomes less than M, i.e. the
 * Poke Mon does not have enough power to reach the next target. Every time you
 * subtract M from N that means you’ve reached a target and poked it
 * successfully. COUNT how many targets you’ve poked – you’ll need that count.
 * The Poke Mon becomes gradually more exhausted. IF N becomes equal to EXACTLY
 * 50 % of its original value, you must divide N by Y, if it is POSSIBLE. This
 * DIVISION is between integers. If a division is not possible, you should NOT
 * do it. Instead, you should continue subtracting. After dividing, you should
 * continue subtracting from N, until it becomes less than M. When N becomes
 * less than M, you must take what has remained of N and the count of targets
 * you’ve poked, and print them as output.
 * 
 * NOTE: When you are calculating percentages, you should be PRECISE at maximum.
 * Example: 505 is NOT EXACTLY 50 % from 1000, its 50.5 %. Input • The input
 * consists of 3 lines. • On the first line you will receive N – an integer. •
 * On the second line you will receive M – an integer. • On the third line you
 * will receive Y – an integer. Output • The output consists of 2 lines. • On
 * the first line print what has remained of N, after subtracting from it. • On
 * the second line print the count of targets, you’ve managed to poke.
 * Constrains • The integer N will be in the range [1, 2.000.000.000]. • The
 * integer M will be in the range [1, 1.000.000]. • The integer Y will be in the
 * range [0, 9]. • Allowed time / memory: 16 MB / 100ms.
